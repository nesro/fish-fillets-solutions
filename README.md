My Fish Fillets Solutions (54/80)
======================

My solutions to the best puzzle game ever: Fish Fillets - New Generation

I solved some levels in a very obscure way. If you want to laugh, check out my
solutions for: "And How It Was", "Silver's Hideout" and
"What Would King Arthur Say?". Now I know that there is a much simplier way
how to solve it, but I want to keep my first solutions just for fun.
I'm not the lowest steps hunter. :)

I play this game mostly in public transport. I have not finished all the
game yet, but I will not play any other game until I solve all levels.
